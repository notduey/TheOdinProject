        <title>T5 Favorite Video Games Ordered</title>
    </head>

    <body>
        <h1>Here's a list of <em><strong>my</strong></em> favorite video games ordered-</h1>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Minecraft:</strong></li>
            <p>It's a timeless classic at this point, and it's fun with <em>or</em> without friends.</p>

            <li><strong>Ark Survival Evolved/Ascended:</strong></li>
            <p>One of the <em><strong>most</strong></em> fun solo games I've ever played, which stemmed from me being into dinosaurs when I was little!
            </p>
            <p>Great comfort game.</p>

            <li><strong>Fortnite:</strong></li>
            <p>Was one of the most fun experiences of my <strong>childhood</strong>; chapter 1 was peak, along with the first half of chapter 2, some of chapter 3, and chapter 4.</p>
            <p>Chapter 5 was mid asf, hopefully <strong>Fortnite OG</strong> can compensate for it being so bad.</p>  

            <li><strong>Roblox:</strong></li>
            <p>Though the game catalog is <em>super</em> desaturated now a days, roblox a couple years ago was hella fun; some new games are still <em>very</em> addicting to play.</p>

            <li><strong>Valorant:</strong></li>
            <p>Kind of an underrated pick because as much I as hated and still hate the game, I had a bunch of good memories playing this.</p>
            <p>Even as I've carried many people to rank up, I've <em>never</em> reached diamond.</p>
            <p>:(</p>

        </ol>
        <h2><em>Honorable Mentions-</em></h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege:</strong></li>
            <p>Tuff game, haven't played it enough to form a solid opinion about it though.</p>

            <li><strong>Bloons Tower Defense 6:</strong></li>
            <p>Super fun game to mess around and waste time, though I'm still pretty sweaty at it.</p>

            <li><strong>Sons of the Forest:</strong></li>
            <p>Had some nice memories on this game, as ironic as it is; I <em>still</em> found the horror game pretty relaxing and <em>calming</em> even to play deep into the nights.</p>
        </ul>
